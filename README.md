Joost's custom Slic3r settings for his Prusa i3 mk2s. ( ~/..Slic3r )

# rigid.ink ASA 1.75mm

+ first layer temperature: 235
+ first layer printing bed temperature: 100
+ subsequent layers temperature: 230 
+ subsequent layers printing bed temperature: 90
+ printing bed: clean PEI
+ printer in enclosure
+ fan speed: 10%
+ bridge fan speed: 30%

# rigid.ink BIOFLEX 1.75mm

+ first layer temperature: 240
+ first layer printing bed temperature: 55
+ subsequent layers temperature: 235 
+ subsequent layers printing bed temperature: 50
+ printing bed: glue stick (to avoid it sticking to the bed permanently)
+ print without enclosure
+ fan speed: 85%
+ bridge fan speed: 100%
+ further tuning is needed (retraction, slowing down, ...)

# rigid.ink PET 1.75mm

+ first layer temperature: 235
+ first layer printing bed temperature: 80
+ subsequent layers temperature: 230 
+ subsequent layers printing bed temperature: 80
+ printing bed: window cleaner (silicone) (to avoid it sticking to the bed)
+ print without enclosure
+ fan speed: 30%
+ bridge fan speed: 50%
+ print off center for small parts to avoid the part cooling fan cooling down the bed to much

# rigid.ink PLA 1.75mm

+ first layer temperature: 195
+ first layer printing bed temperature: 55
+ subsequent layers temperature: 180 
+ subsequent layers printing bed temperature: 45
+ printing bed: clean PEI, cleaned with Isopropanol Alcohol
+ print without enclosure
+ fan speed: 85%
+ bridge fan speed: 100%
+ even lower bed temperature might still be possible
